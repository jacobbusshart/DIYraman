This module provides the minimum optical path you need to record your first Raman spectra.</p> <p>The design shown here is built around a surplus B&amp;W Tek spectrometer module, which is commonly available on the used market for around 200\u20ac. Other spectrometers with a similar input geometry / SMA905-connector can also be adapted.</p> <p>For cost reasons, this setup uses a low-cost 532\u202fnm green laser pointer together with a dichroic mirror (cut-on 550\u202fnm) and a longpass filter (cut-on 550\u202fnm). You can find more information in the Parts and Materials section below. Because the laser operates at 532\u202fnm and the filters begin transmitting at 550\u202fnm, the usable Raman signal will be in the Stokes region above roughly 600\u202fcm\u207b\u00b9.</p> <p>[!NOTE] Full vs. Basic Optical Assembly The Full Raman Optical Assembly incorporates the Linear Translation Stage along with two stepper motors to motorise the kinematic laser mount for convenience.

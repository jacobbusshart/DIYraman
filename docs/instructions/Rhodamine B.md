## Preparing the Fluorescent Solution

Rhodamine B does not have a long shelf life and should be prepared fresh. When it is dissolved in solution it gradually loses parts of its fluorescent properties over time. Note that the ideal working concentration of Rhodamine B in water is ~0.05 mg / 100 mL, so incredibly little is needed and the stock solution has to be diluted. Fortunately, the range is very forgiving, meaning you will most likely only ever use too much, rather than too little.  


### Step 1 - Making a concentrated stock solution

![](../../assets/images_picked/Cuvette-RhodamineB/Cuvette_RhodamineB_Still-1_350px-JPG.jpg)

Fill a small glass container with distilled water. Here, an arbitrary amount of about 50 ml is chosen.


![](../../assets/images_picked/Cuvette-RhodamineB/Cuvette_RhodamineB_Still-2_350px-JPG.jpg)

Carefully open your Rhodamine B bottle and dispense it by lightly tapping the container, until the first pink streaks appear in the water. The concentration needed is tiny - think less than a single dose of a salt shaker.

Accuracy isn't critical here, since fluorescence is inherently intense, easily observable and the dye very forgiving.

Swirl the solution gently, while being careful not to spill any of the dye. If particles remain visible, add more water to create a homogenous solution.

### Step 2 - Diluting to reach optimal concentration

![](../../assets/images_picked/Cuvette-RhodamineB/Cuvette_RhodamineB_Still-5_350px-JPG.jpg)

For this volume of water, it is recommended to subsequently dilute 1:20. 

> [!TIP]
> If you want to be precise, you can first prepare a 1mM stock solution by **dissolving ~5 mg (4.79 mg) in 10 ml** of water, then **dilute 1:100** to get a 10 µM solution. 


![](../../assets/images_picked/Cuvette-RhodamineB/Cuvette_RhodamineB_Still-6_350px-JPG.jpg)

Use a designated pipette to draw up a couple of drops of the diluted Rhodamine-solution. Make sure to fill the cuvette just enough to sufficiently cover the circular opening of the printed part.

Don't fill it up more than necessary - this reduces the risk of spillage and makes handling easier and safer. If your cuvette came with a lid, you can put it on now.

### Step 3 - Putting cuvette in printed housing

![](../../assets/images_picked/Cuvette-RhodamineB/Cuvette_RhodamineB_Still-8_350px-JPG.jpg)

Slide the cuvette into the printed base part that features the opening for the microscope. If the contents of the cuvette can only be viewed from the front and back, make sure to seat it rotated correctly towards the opening hole.   


![](../../assets/images_picked/Cuvette-RhodamineB/Cuvette_RhodamineB_Still-9_350px-JPG.jpg)

Press it into place by using light pressure.

### Step 4 - Done

![](../../assets/images_picked/Cuvette-RhodamineB/Cuvette_RhodamineB_Still-10_350px-JPG.jpg)

Slide the lid over the cuvette and the printed case. The fit is meant to create noticeable friction to ensure it sits sufficiently tight and doesn't accidentally come off.
